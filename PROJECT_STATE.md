## Post-MVP Active Work

**Commit 17 — AI-Assisted Candidate Profile Import**

Status: **Implementation in progress**

Active pull request:

**None**

This authorized post-MVP milestone adds optional AI-assisted Candidate Profile
drafts from pasted résumé text and supported PDF/DOCX files. Drafts require
explicit human review and Apply before entering editable Candidate Profile
fields. Candidate Preferences are excluded. Draft generation does not run
analysis or save history. Deterministic analysis remains unchanged.

## Existing Capabilities

The repository already contains:

- Python 3.13 project foundation and tooling
- typed job-description and candidate-profile domains
- deterministic candidate-job matching
- structured match explanations and gap analysis
- deterministic interview preparation
- deterministic targeted learning recommendations
- provider-neutral optional AI enrichment
- typed FastAPI analysis endpoints and error contracts
- version-2 SQLite persistence for complete analysis snapshots
- saved-analysis list and detail API endpoints
- an explicit local SQLite persistence runtime
- a React/TypeScript/Vite web experience for new and saved analyses
- deterministic role-relevant skill import from pasted résumé text
- deterministic PDF/DOCX résumé file skill import
- explicit optional OpenAI enrichment with server-side configuration
- capability discovery and default-off Web AI opt-in
- optional AI-assisted job-description drafting
- optional AI-assisted Candidate Profile drafting on the active branch
- explicit draft review/apply workflows

## Architectural Boundary

Core matching, explanation, interview preparation, and learning recommendations
remain deterministic and independent of:

- LLMs
- external course catalogs
- FastAPI
- databases
- external providers
- UI frameworks

AI enrichment remains separate from deterministic scoring and recommendations.
Résumé skill import is also deterministic and independent of LLMs, persistence,
and external services. AI-assisted Candidate Profile drafting is a distinct,
explicit external-processing workflow and remains outside the domain boundary
until the user applies reviewed fields.

## Next Post-MVP Milestone

None currently authorized.

## State Update Rule

After every merged roadmap or authorized post-MVP pull request:

1. update the `main` SHA above
2. mark the merged milestone complete
3. remove it from active work
4. set the next authorized milestone as active work, if one exists
5. preserve completed milestone history

If repository contents and this file disagree without an explicit maintainer
exception, stop and ask the human maintainer which state is authoritative before
implementing further work.
