## Post-MVP Active Work

**Commit 25 — Application Follow-Up Date**

Status: **PR under review**

Active pull request:

**PR #29**

https://github.com/JervisAnthony/pathfinder-ai/pull/29

This authorized post-MVP milestone adds one optional, user-managed calendar
follow-up date to each saved analysis. Additive SQLite metadata remains separate
from the immutable snapshot, status, activity, notes, exports, comparison,
deterministic analysis, and optional AI. The Web provides explicit Save and
confirmation-gated Clear actions and displays dates in History.

The maintainer explicitly authorized reconciliation of the stale Commit 24
state: PR #28 merged at main `7fd4a7d16b1f5b8b04bd19e517fa998abed78fc1`.
Human-owned checkpoint commits and staging do not mark this milestone complete;
review and merge remain pending.

## Existing Capabilities

The repository already contains:

- Python 3.13 project foundation and tooling
- typed job-description and candidate-profile domains
- deterministic candidate-job matching
- structured match explanations and gap analysis
- deterministic interview preparation
- deterministic targeted learning recommendations
- provider-neutral optional AI enrichment
- typed FastAPI analysis endpoints and error contracts
- version-2 SQLite persistence for complete analysis snapshots
- saved-analysis list, detail, and individual delete API endpoints
- an explicit local SQLite persistence runtime
- a React/TypeScript/Vite web experience for new and saved analyses
- deterministic role-relevant skill import from pasted résumé text
- deterministic PDF/DOCX résumé file skill import
- explicit optional OpenAI enrichment with server-side configuration
- capability discovery and default-off Web AI opt-in
- optional AI-assisted job-description drafting
- optional AI-assisted Candidate Profile drafting
- explicit draft review/apply workflows
- confirmation-gated deletion of individual saved-analysis snapshots
- saved-history title/company search, AI presence filters, and inclusive score bounds
- explicit JSON and deterministic Markdown downloads of individual saved snapshots
- descriptive comparison of two saved snapshots with neutral deltas and skill/gap sets
- explicit saved-analysis application status with server-side History filtering
- paginated application-status activity for saved analysis detail
- private, user-authored application notes on saved analysis detail

## Architectural Boundary

Core matching, explanation, interview preparation, and learning recommendations
remain deterministic and independent of:

- LLMs
- external course catalogs
- FastAPI
- databases
- external providers
- UI frameworks

AI enrichment remains separate from deterministic scoring and recommendations.
Résumé skill import is also deterministic and independent of LLMs, persistence,
and external services. AI-assisted Candidate Profile drafting is a distinct,
explicit external-processing workflow and remains outside the domain boundary
until the user applies reviewed fields.

## Next Post-MVP Milestone

None currently authorized.

## State Update Rule

After every merged roadmap or authorized post-MVP pull request:

1. update the `main` SHA above
2. mark the merged milestone complete
3. remove it from active work
4. set the next authorized milestone as active work, if one exists
5. preserve completed milestone history

If repository contents and this file disagree without an explicit maintainer
exception, stop and ask the human maintainer which state is authoritative before
implementing further work.
