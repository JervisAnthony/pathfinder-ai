## Post-MVP Active Work

**Commit 27 — Application Pipeline Dashboard**

Status: **Authorized active development; local implementation prepared for human review**

The read-only Application Pipeline Overview summarizes all saved analysis records,
independently of History filters. It shows totals, all seven effective application
status counts, scheduled/unscheduled follow-up counts, and the five earliest
scheduled dates with existing Saved Analysis Detail navigation. Past dates remain
eligible; multiple saved snapshots count separately. SQLite aggregates persisted
metadata and selects five entries in one consistent read transaction without
snapshot decoding, writes, schema changes, or changes to payload version 2.
The Web loads the overview independently, guards stale requests, supports retry,
and refreshes both resources explicitly and the overview on return from Detail.
No reminders, urgency classifications, deduplication, predictions, AI/provider
calls, external integrations, polling, or browser storage are introduced.

The maintainer authorized reconciliation of Commit 26 following the verified
merge of PR #30 at `1afeb4c79c4650c1ddda80314fd47a20bf1503d5`.
Codex performs local implementation, tests, validation, review, and staging.
The human maintainer owns the single implementation commit, publication,
pull request, review, and merge. No Commit 27 PR number is assigned.
Local implementation does not mark this milestone merged or complete.

## Existing Capabilities

The repository already contains:

- Python 3.13 project foundation and tooling
- typed job-description and candidate-profile domains
- deterministic candidate-job matching
- structured match explanations and gap analysis
- deterministic interview preparation
- deterministic targeted learning recommendations
- provider-neutral optional AI enrichment
- typed FastAPI analysis endpoints and error contracts
- version-2 SQLite persistence for complete analysis snapshots
- saved-analysis list, detail, and individual delete API endpoints
- an explicit local SQLite persistence runtime
- a React/TypeScript/Vite web experience for new and saved analyses
- deterministic role-relevant skill import from pasted résumé text
- deterministic PDF/DOCX résumé file skill import
- explicit optional OpenAI enrichment with server-side configuration
- capability discovery and default-off Web AI opt-in
- optional AI-assisted job-description drafting
- optional AI-assisted Candidate Profile drafting
- explicit draft review/apply workflows
- confirmation-gated deletion of individual saved-analysis snapshots
- saved-history title/company search, AI presence filters, and inclusive score bounds
- explicit JSON and deterministic Markdown downloads of individual saved snapshots
- descriptive comparison of two saved snapshots with neutral deltas and skill/gap sets
- explicit saved-analysis application status with server-side History filtering
- paginated application-status activity for saved analysis detail
- private, user-authored application notes on saved analysis detail
- one optional user-managed follow-up calendar date per saved analysis
- persisted follow-up presence/date filters and stable earliest-follow-up History ordering

## Architectural Boundary

Core matching, explanation, interview preparation, and learning recommendations
remain deterministic and independent of:

- LLMs
- external course catalogs
- FastAPI
- databases
- external providers
- UI frameworks

AI enrichment remains separate from deterministic scoring and recommendations.
Résumé skill import is also deterministic and independent of LLMs, persistence,
and external services. AI-assisted Candidate Profile drafting is a distinct,
explicit external-processing workflow and remains outside the domain boundary
until the user applies reviewed fields.

## Next Post-MVP Milestone

None currently authorized.

## State Update Rule

Reconcile merged milestone history in the next authorized implementation commit;
do not create a separate documentation commit solely to record a PR number.
Record the actual PR number in GitHub PR metadata and description.

When reconciling a merged roadmap or authorized post-MVP pull request:

1. update the `main` SHA above
2. mark the merged milestone complete
3. remove it from active work
4. set the next authorized milestone as active work, if one exists
5. preserve completed milestone history

If repository contents and this file disagree without an explicit maintainer
exception, stop and ask the human maintainer which state is authoritative before
implementing further work.
