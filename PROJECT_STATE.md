## Post-MVP Active Work

**Commit 20 — Saved Analysis Export & Portability**

Status: **Implementation in progress**

Active pull request:

None

This authorized post-MVP milestone adds explicit JSON and Markdown downloads of
one existing saved snapshot from its Web detail view. JSON reuses the public
saved-detail contract. Markdown is rendered by a deterministic application module
with centralized escaping of stored text, using only the saved timestamp/results.

Exports do not recompute analysis, invoke AI or import/drafting workflows, mutate
snapshots, write persistence, or store report files on the server. UUID-derived
attachment filenames, no-store responses, and nosniff headers protect the download
contract. Downloaded files may contain sensitive structured candidate/job data
and become the user's responsibility outside Pathfinder.

SQLite schema and version-2 snapshot payloads remain unchanged. No dependencies,
browser storage, deterministic-core changes, AI behavior changes, or next-milestone
scope are introduced. Existing history filters and individual deletion remain intact.

## Existing Capabilities

The repository already contains:

- Python 3.13 project foundation and tooling
- typed job-description and candidate-profile domains
- deterministic candidate-job matching
- structured match explanations and gap analysis
- deterministic interview preparation
- deterministic targeted learning recommendations
- provider-neutral optional AI enrichment
- typed FastAPI analysis endpoints and error contracts
- version-2 SQLite persistence for complete analysis snapshots
- saved-analysis list, detail, and individual delete API endpoints
- an explicit local SQLite persistence runtime
- a React/TypeScript/Vite web experience for new and saved analyses
- deterministic role-relevant skill import from pasted résumé text
- deterministic PDF/DOCX résumé file skill import
- explicit optional OpenAI enrichment with server-side configuration
- capability discovery and default-off Web AI opt-in
- optional AI-assisted job-description drafting
- optional AI-assisted Candidate Profile drafting
- explicit draft review/apply workflows
- confirmation-gated deletion of individual saved-analysis snapshots
- saved-history title/company search, AI presence filters, and inclusive score bounds
- explicit JSON and deterministic Markdown downloads of individual saved snapshots

## Architectural Boundary

Core matching, explanation, interview preparation, and learning recommendations
remain deterministic and independent of:

- LLMs
- external course catalogs
- FastAPI
- databases
- external providers
- UI frameworks

AI enrichment remains separate from deterministic scoring and recommendations.
Résumé skill import is also deterministic and independent of LLMs, persistence,
and external services. AI-assisted Candidate Profile drafting is a distinct,
explicit external-processing workflow and remains outside the domain boundary
until the user applies reviewed fields.

## Next Post-MVP Milestone

None currently authorized.

## State Update Rule

After every merged roadmap or authorized post-MVP pull request:

1. update the `main` SHA above
2. mark the merged milestone complete
3. remove it from active work
4. set the next authorized milestone as active work, if one exists
5. preserve completed milestone history

If repository contents and this file disagree without an explicit maintainer
exception, stop and ask the human maintainer which state is authoritative before
implementing further work.
