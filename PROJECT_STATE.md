Current completed roadmap milestone on `main`:

**Commit 15 — Optional OpenAI AI Enrichment**

## Completed MVP-1 Roadmap

- Commit 1 — Repository Foundation — complete

- Commit 14 — Deterministic Resume File Skill Import — complete (PR #18 merged)
- Commit 15 — Optional OpenAI AI Enrichment — complete (PR #19 merged)

## Post-MVP Active Work

**Commit 16 — AI-Assisted Job Description Import**

Status: **PR under review**

Active pull request:

**PR #20 — Add AI-assisted job description import**

https://github.com/JervisAnthony/pathfinder-ai/pull/20

This authorized post-MVP milestone adds optional AI-assisted structured drafts
from supplied job-posting text. Drafts require explicit human review and Apply
before entering editable Target Job fields. Draft generation does not run
analysis or save history. Deterministic analysis remains unchanged.

## Existing Capabilities

The repository already contains:

- Python 3.13 project foundation and tooling
- typed job-description and candidate-profile domains
- deterministic candidate-job matching
- structured match explanations and gap analysis
- deterministic interview preparation
- deterministic targeted learning recommendations
- provider-neutral optional AI enrichment
- typed FastAPI analysis endpoints and error contracts
- version-2 SQLite persistence for complete analysis snapshots
- saved-analysis list and detail API endpoints
- an explicit local SQLite persistence runtime
- a React/TypeScript/Vite web experience for new and saved analyses
- deterministic role-relevant skill import from pasted résumé text
- deterministic PDF/DOCX résumé file skill import
- explicit optional OpenAI enrichment with server-side configuration
- capability discovery and default-off Web AI opt-in
- optional AI-assisted job-description drafting on the active branch
- explicit draft review/apply workflow on the active branch

## Architectural Boundary

Core matching, explanation, interview preparation, and learning recommendations
remain deterministic and independent of:

- LLMs
- external course catalogs
- FastAPI
- databases
- external providers
- UI frameworks

AI enrichment remains separate from deterministic scoring and recommendations.
Résumé skill import is also deterministic and independent of LLMs, persistence,
and external services.

## Next Post-MVP Milestone

None currently authorized.

## State Update Rule

After every merged roadmap or authorized post-MVP pull request:

1. update the `main` SHA above
2. mark the merged milestone complete
3. remove it from active work
4. set the next authorized milestone as active work, if one exists
5. preserve completed milestone history

If repository contents and this file disagree without an explicit maintainer
exception, stop and ask the human maintainer which state is authoritative before
implementing further work.
